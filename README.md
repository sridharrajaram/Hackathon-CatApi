# Hackathon-CatApi


Task Name : CAT API 


Implement the Cat API using async/await with fetch.


Constraints:

    All your HTML elements should be created with DOM. 

    Use the async/await.

    Use try catch to handle errors.

    Use fetch() to get the data from Cats Api

    All JavaScript codes should be in a script file named script.js which has to be imported in your HTML page.


How do I process the API data?z

    List all the cats on the screen with a given api https://cataas.com/api/cats.

    Place a search bar on the top of your webpage and filter cats based on the searched keyword using this api https://cataas.com/api/cats?tags=cute.

    Display the cat image in a popup on your webpage.

    To get the image url, append the cat id with the url.
